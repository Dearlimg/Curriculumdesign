西安邮电大学,智能科学与技术专业,人工智能课程设计,
由"组一辈子乐队"队伍合力编写,

这个课设的难度偏大,因为平台是一个BS架构的web项目,智能专业并未学习web开发课程,
所以对于大部分同学来说都是比较难去理解和操作的,好在我和队伍中的另一个同学都是经过系统学习web开发,
我主Golang,他主Java,有web项目基础,所以编写对我们来说很简单.

这个项目的实现思想很简单,我愿叫为朴素算法--单纯使用bfs去搜索最短路径,
然后在这个的基础上进行优化,加入了一些简单的逻辑判断,以及一些自己的想法.

我们没有采用那四个推荐算法的原因是实现难度过大,以往的智能课设都是单纯的bfs,dfs,A*.
直到22届开始这个web平台的课设,难度陡增.

然后由于我们没有系统学习过python,所以编写的python不是很规范,因为语法不熟悉,
(还有就是这个python的语法我们特反感,太胶水了,QAQ),项目整体架构比较简单,
具有OOP思想的都能看懂.

Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Artificial Intelligence Curriculum Design for Intelligent Science and Technology,
Written by the team of "The Last Life Band",
The difficulty of this course is on the high side, because the platform is a BS architecture web project, and the intelligence major does not study web development courses.
Therefore, it is difficult for most students to understand and operate, but fortunately, I and another student in the team have learned web development through the system.
I'm Golang, he's Java, and I have a web project base, so it's very easy for us to write.

The idea of this project is very simple, I would like to call it a naïve algorithm - simply use BFS to search for the shortest path.
Then optimize on the basis of this, add some simple logical judgments, and some own ideas.

The reason why we didn't use the four recommendation algorithms is that it is too difficult to implement, and the previous intelligent courses are simple bfs, dfs, and A*.
Until the beginning of the 22nd session, the difficulty of this web platform increased dramatically.

And then since we haven't learned python systematically, the python we write is not very standardized, because the syntax is not familiar,
(There is also the syntax of this python that we are particularly disgusted with, to glue, QAQ), the overall architecture of the project is relatively simple,
Anyone with OOP thinking can understand it.
